    <p>Ella completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Spanish with a specialization in Linguistics and a minor in Cultural Anthropology from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>, Ann Arbor in 2017. After graduation, she worked in UofM's <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~speechlab/" target="_blank">Speech Production Lab</a>, managing various projects focusing of Second Language Acquisition and Sociophonetics. There, she learned to work in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank">R</a>, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Her love of working with and analyzing data led her to begin graduate studies in Linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, Seattle.</p>
    
    <p>While she ultimately decided stop pursuing her degree at UW to focus on a career in Web Design, through her coursework, she was able to invaluably broaden her knowledge of Linguistics, Scientific Research, Data Sciences, and also, Web Development. As the UW Linguistics Department's Laboratory Student Assistant for two years, she worked closely with Lab Directors to manage lab activites, including maintaining and updating the lab websites. Her most prized accomplishment in this position was developing a <a href="https://zeos.ling.washington.edu/PNWEnglish/quizzes/vowelSpace.php" target="_blank">Web Application</a> in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/" target="_blank"> R Shiny</a> for users to interact with research data. Through this experience, she developed a deep interest in Web Design and Development which led her to where she is today.</p>

    <p>Ella lives in Seattle, WA with her husband, Ben, and their beloved cat, Remy.</p>
